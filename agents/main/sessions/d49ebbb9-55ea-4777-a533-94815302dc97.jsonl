The user asked for the Bitcoin price, and I tried using the browser tool to search it on Google. But there was an error because the Chrome extension relay isn't connected. Hmm, maybe the user hasn't attached a tab yet.\n\nWait, the error message says that the Chrome extension is running but no tab is connected. So I need to prompt the user to attach a tab. How do I do that? The instructions mention clicking the OpenClaw Browser Relay toolbar icon on a tab. But since I can't interact with the user's browser directly, maybe I should ask them to check if they have a tab attached.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method to get the Bitcoin price without relying on the browser. Oh, but the SOUL.md rules say that I must use the browser for any search. So I have to ensure the browser is properly connected. Let me check if there's another way to trigger the browser correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the profile was set to \"chrome\" but the user hasn't attached a tab yet. The error mentions that the Chrome extension relay is running but no tab is connected. So maybe I should ask the user to attach a tab by clicking the OpenClaw icon on their browser. Since I can't do that automatically, I need to inform them to do so.\n\nBut how to communicate this? The user might not know about the Chrome extension. Maybe I should send a message explaining that they need to connect a tab via the extension. However, according to the tools, the message function is available. Let me use the message tool to ask them to attach a tab.\n\nWait, but the current error is preventing the browser from opening. So maybe I should first handle the error by instructing the user on how to fix it. Then retry the search once the connection is established. Let me draft a response explaining the issue and asking them to connect a tab.\n","thinkingSignature":"reasoning_content"},{"type":"text","text":"\n\nPara buscar o preço do Bitcoin, preciso que você conecte um aba ao OpenClaw Browser Relay.
