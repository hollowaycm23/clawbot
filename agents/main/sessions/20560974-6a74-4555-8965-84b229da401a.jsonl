Let me start by understanding what they need.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's any recent information on GPU production. The user mentioned \"ultimas noticias\" which means latest news, so I should look for up-to-date sources. Since the available tools require using the web-search-skill for real-time info, I'll have to use that.\n\nI remember from SOUL.md that whenever there's a query about current events or data that changes frequently, like production statuses, I must use the web-search-skill. The user is asking about when production normalized, so this is time-sensitive information.\n\nLet me structure my approach: \n\n1. Use the web-search-skill to search for recent news on GPU production resuming normal levels. The query should be in Portuguese since the user communicates in PT-BR. Maybe \"produção de placas de vídeo volta à normalidade 2026\" or similar.\n\n2. Analyze the results from the search to find credible sources, like tech news websites or official statements from manufacturers like NVIDIA or AMD.\n\n3. Compile the information into a concise answer for the user, highlighting when production resumed and any key points from the news articles.\n\nWait, but the web-search-skill's parameters need the query as a string. Let me make sure to format that correctly. Also, I need to ensure the search is in Portuguese to get relevant results for the user's context.\n\nI should also check if there are any recent events in 2026 affecting GPU production. Maybe there were supply chain issues or new product launches that caused delays. The answer should mention any specific dates or periods when production normalized.\n\nAfter getting the search results, I'll need to extract the most relevant information. For example, if a news article states that as of January 2026, NVIDIA resumed normal production after a Q4 2025 delay due to component shortages, that's key info to include.\n\nI should also mention any factors affecting production, like increased demand for AI and cryptocurrency mining, which might have caused delays. But since the user asked specifically about when it returned to normal, focus on the timeline.\n\nFinally, present the answer in clear Portuguese, summarizing the latest news and the current status of GPU production.\n","thinkingSignature":"reasoning_content"},{"type":"text","text":"\n\n"},{"type":"toolCall","id":"646376523","name":"web-search-skill","arguments":{"query":"ultimas noticias sobre placas de video producao normal 2026"}}],"api":"openai-completions","provider":"lm-studio","model":"qwen3-14b","usage":{"input":12272,"output":519,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":12791,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1769917622363}}

I provided information from two articles discussing NVIDIA's potential price increases and the relaunch of older models. This seems like valuable information that might be useful for future reference.\n\nHowever, the current task is to store durable memories. Since the user hasn't explicitly asked for me to save specific information, but the system prompt says to capture what matters, I should consider if there's any key point from the interaction that needs preservation. The main points were about NVIDIA's production issues and market strategies. \n\nBut since the user's latest message is a directive to store memories without specifying content, maybe there's no new information to add.
